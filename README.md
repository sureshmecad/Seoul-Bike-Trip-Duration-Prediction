## This project is implemented in Python and gathers tasks of :  
* Data visualisation : show correlations between the data and the target on the Jupyter Notebook
* Machine learning algorithm modelisation on the Jupyter Notebook
* Transformation of the model into an API Flask
  
 
## You will find in this repositery :   
* A [LaTeX report of the study](//github.com/sureshmecad/Seoul-Bike-Trip-Duration-Prediction/blob/master/Project%202%20-%20Seoul%20Bike%20Trip%20Duration.pdf.pdf)
* The [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/sureshmecad/Seoul-Bike-Trip-Duration-Prediction/blob/master/code/1_Seoul_Bike_Trip_Final.ipynb)
* The transformation of the model into an API 
<br> 

## Conclusion : 

You can check below the result of the deployment of our Machine Learning model : LGBM(Light Gradient Regressor) which had the best score among the models.
